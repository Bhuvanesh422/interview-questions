    <div class="question-container">
        <h3>Question 3: What is a RESTful Web API in .NET Core?</h3>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> A RESTful Web API in .NET Core is a set of HTTP services that provide access to resources for clients.</p>
        <p><strong>Syntax:</strong></p>
        <code>
            [HttpGet]
            public IActionResult GetAllStudents() {

        </code>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> The `*ngIf` directive displays an element if the condition is true.</p>
        <p><strong>How it will be used in my project:</strong> In the Education ERP solution, we used `ngIf` to display dynamic content based on user roles.</p>
        <p><strong>Real-world example:</strong> Showing or hiding content on a dashboard based on user permissions.</p>
        <p><strong>What kind of task will be asked:</strong> You may be asked to implement custom directives or use built-in directives like `ngIf` and `ngFor`.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Question 5 -->
    <div class="question-container">
        <h3>Question 5: How does Angular Handle Forms?</h3>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Angular provides two ways to handle forms: template-driven and reactive forms.</p>
        <p><strong>Syntax:</strong></p>
        <code>
            Reactive Form:
            this.form = this.fb.group({
                name: ['', Validators.required]
            });
        </code>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> A reactive form with validation for a name input field.</p>
        <p><strong>How it will be used in my project:</strong> In the ERP solution, reactive forms are used to validate user input before submitting it to the server.</p>
        <p><strong>Real-world example:</strong> Registration forms with validation in an e-commerce site, where fields are validated before submitting data.</p>
        <p><strong>What kind of task will be asked:</strong> You may be asked to implement forms, add validations, or handle form submission in Angular applications.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Question 6 -->
    <div class="question-container">
        <h3>Question 6: What is SQL Joins?</h3>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> SQL Joins are used to combine records from two or more tables based on a related column between them.</p>
        <p><strong>Syntax:</strong></p>
        <code>
            SELECT orders.OrderID, customers.CustomerName
            FROM orders
            INNER JOIN customers ON orders.CustomerID = customers.CustomerID;
        </code>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> The query joins orders and customers tables based on the CustomerID column.</p>
        <p><strong>How it will be used in my project:</strong> In the Education ERP solution, joins are used to fetch related data like student and class details.</p>
        <p><strong>Real-world example:</strong> Joining an orders table with a customer table to show details of customer orders.</p>
        <p><strong>What kind of task will be asked:</strong> You may be asked to write SQL queries to fetch data using various types of joins (inner, left, right, full).</p>
    </div>

<div class="question-container">
        <h3>Question 7: What is Angular Routing?</h3>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Angular routing is a feature that allows you to navigate between different views or components in an Angular application without refreshing the entire page.</p>
        <p><strong>Syntax:</strong></p>
        <code>
            const routes: Routes = [
                { path: 'home', component: HomeComponent },
                { path: 'about', component: AboutComponent }
            ];
        </code>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> This allows a user to click on a link and move between different sections of an application like Home, About, etc.</p>
        <p><strong>How it will be used in my project:</strong> In the Education ERP solution, routing helps users navigate through different modules like student information, faculty, and administrative sections.</p>
        <p><strong>Real world example:</strong> Navigating between profile, settings, and dashboard in a web application like Google or Facebook without reloading the whole page.</p>
        <p><strong>What kind of task will be asked from this question:</strong> You might be asked to configure routes in an Angular application, set up child routes, or enable lazy loading for optimization.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question-container">
        <h3>Question 8: What is Dependency Injection in Angular?</h3>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern in Angular where the framework provides instances of a class to another class without hardcoding the instantiation.</p>
        <p><strong>Syntax:</strong></p>
        <code>
            @Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })
            export class MyService {
                constructor() {}
            }

            export class MyComponent {
                constructor(private myService: MyService) {}
            }
        </code>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> Injecting a service into a component so that the component can use the functionality provided by the service.</p>
        <p><strong>How it will be used in my project:</strong> In the Education ERP solution, services like student management, reporting, and authentication are injected into various components for code reusability and modularization.</p>
        <p><strong>Real world example:</strong> When logging into a system, the authentication service is injected into the login component to handle user validation.</p>
        <p><strong>What kind of task will be asked from this question:</strong> You may be asked to implement a service and inject it into multiple components or understand different DI scopes (singleton or not).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question-container">
        <h3>Question 9: What are Angular Directives?</h3>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Directives are classes in Angular that add behavior to elements in your Angular applications.</p>
        <p><strong>Syntax:</strong></p>
        <code>
            &lt;div *ngIf="isVisible"&gt;Content here&lt;/div&gt;
        </code>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> The `*ngIf` directive conditionally renders elements based on the expression provided.</p>
        <p><strong>How it will be used in my project:</strong> In the Education ERP solution, `ngIf` is used to show or hide elements like user actions based on their permissions.</p>
        <p><strong>Real world example:</strong> Displaying or hiding buttons based on user role (admin, student, faculty) in a portal.</p>
        <p><strong>What kind of task will be asked from this question:</strong> Implement custom directives to manipulate DOM elements, handle events, or conditionally display content.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question-container">
        <h3>Question 9: What is Two-way Data Binding in Angular?</h3>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Two-way data binding in Angular allows synchronization between the data model and the view, so that changes in one are reflected in the other.</p>
        <p><strong>Syntax:</strong></p>
        <code>
            &lt;input [(ngModel)]="name" /&gt;
